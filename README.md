# OpenInApp-assignment
Doing OpenInApp assignment for Backend Intern role. 

This project is a Node.js(Express) app which sends automatic replies to our mails. 

This a feature is particularly useful if we are on a vacation or out of station and we are not able to reply to our mails.

Improvements that I am working on:

1. I have to segregate the code into service classes so that the code is more understandable and reusable
2. I have to add more validations like ignoring no-reply emails etc
3. I have to do include Error Handling code.
4. I have to change labels for the auto-replied mails(Have to resolve some Permission Errors).
